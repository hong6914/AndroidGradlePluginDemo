# AndroidGradlePluginDemo
A simple POC plugin on how to deal with Google's Android Transform API for the build, and hooks into different places of the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP).

Inside the app's build.gradle you control how to run the transforms by the parameters passed in its constructor. And the simple Gradle plugin allows you to touch different phases of the build.

Have fun :-)
